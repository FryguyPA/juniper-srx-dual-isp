This folder contains the start files for the Juniper SRX Dual ISP lab

The files are named as follows:
    _set.txt    - Set based configuration files
    _stanza.txt - Stanza based configuration files


ISP1            - ISP1 configurations
ISP2            - ISP2 configurations
vSRX            - Customer vSRX device
vEX             - Customer vEX device for internal network


Note:  With the ISP devices, ge-0/0/0 was configured for my home lab network.  
       You will need to update the interface and routing commands to reflect 
       your lab/network.  Also note that you will need to update the default
       route under routing-options.
